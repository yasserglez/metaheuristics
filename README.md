Metaheuristics in C#
--------------------

This project was created by [Ariel Hernández Amador][gnuaha7] and
[Yasser González Fernández][ygf] as the final assignment of a
course on metaheuristics taught at the University of Havana, Cuba.
The assignment consisted of a competition in which each team had to
implement a group of metaheuristics to solve four well-known discrete
optimization problems. All the algorithms were run in a group of
benchmark problems and the teams were ranked according to the results
achieved by their algorithms. Both the number of metaheuristics
implemented by each team and the results of the algorithms were
considered to rank the teams. So, each team had to implement a wide
range of metaheuristics and obtain good results. We finished first!

The implemented metaheuristics are:

* Genetic Algorithm (GA),
* Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP),
* Iterated Local Search (ILS),
* Memetic Algorithms (MA),
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
* Simulated Annealing (SA),
* Scatter Search (SS),
* Tabu Search (TS),
* Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA),
* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),
* and a few Hybrid Metaheuristics (HM).

The problems are:

* Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
* Set Partition Problem (SPP),
* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
* and 2-Dimensional Strip Packing (2SP).
